## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I finally decided to make a bit of an effort to share what keeps me busy here. So check the sections below if you're interested:

### About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [AI generated comics that tell the true stories of the world](https://indy-comics.instrukt.ai)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning whatever my YouTube algorithms present in my feed
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI projects that benefit humanity
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything, because doing stuff together is more fun!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI implementations, so we can iterate together over emerging insights
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via my profile details but be sure to find me online by my real name as well (Maurice Faber)

### My latest projects

- [Mo'z AI assistant](https://maurice.instrukt.ai): you can ask questions about me and book a meeting if you so desire (adding tools and vectorized knowledge regularly)
- [Indy Comics](https://indy-comics.instrukt.ai): My ongoing effort to publish factual news packaged into comic book format (for obvious reasons ;)
- [Indy News](https://github.com/Morriz/indy-news): An api powered by AI (RAG) and automation that aims to find relevant independent news on YouTube and X
- [itsUP](https://github.com/Morriz/itsUP): Lean, automated, poor man's infra for lightweight services running in docker, that can be controlled with this [itsUP agent prompt](https://github.com/Morriz/itsUP/blob/main/prompts/itsUP-Agent.txt) when the agent is connected to [the itsUP API ](https://github.com/Morriz/itsUP/blob/main/openapi.yaml)
- [AI assistant for the city of Utrecht](https://utrecht.ai-assistent.app): demo to show how AI can be used by the government to alleviate humans from repetitive tasks

### My YouTube AI subscriptions

From a thorough **informational** perspective (in order of relevancy):

- [AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@aiexplained-official): very insightful research into important AI developments (high level, need to know basics of AI solutions and patterns)
- [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/@YannicKilcher): PhD level scientist that explains interesting AI papers and wether they hold up to his scrutiny (very high level)
- [Wes Roth](https://www.youtube.com/@WesRoth): great voice, good selection of subjects, bit drawn out to make posts lengthy I guess (medium level, helpful to know basics)
- [Matt Berman](https://www.youtube.com/@matthew_berman): nice, simple explanation of actual AI developments (beginner/medium level)
- [The AI Grid](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAiGrid): a guy that uses too many words imo to get to the crux of things (medium level, helpful to know basics)
- [AI Flux](https://www.youtube.com/@aifluxchannel/videos): covers real implementations and tech that power AI (medium level, need to know basics)
- [Matt Wolfe](https://www.youtube.com/@matthew_berman): a very lovable guy who is too loud to listen to but presents a lot of new AI tools (beginner/medium level)
- [World of AI](https://www.youtube.com/@intheworldofai): frequent posts that cover many AI subjects (of which many are not interesting), but has sometimes interesting new stuff (beginner/medium level)

From a **hands on** perspective so that you learn through watching and perhaps doing at the same time:

- [Cole Medin](https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin): he is usually on top of the best AI tools and solutions and shows how to use them (beginner level since his start, but progressed to medium level)
- [Prompt Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerprompt): hands on guy walking you through AI development stuff (medium level, helpful to know basics)
- [Sam Witteveen](https://www.youtube.com/@samwitteveenai): hands on guy that walks you through notebooks to prototype real solutions, easier when you know some coding (medium level, helpful to know basics)
- [AI Jason](https://www.youtube.com/@AIJasonZ/videos): hands on guy that covers the steps to make use of AI tools to create code and build apps get real things done (beginner/medium level)

From a **philosophical** perspective:

- [David Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveShap): current and future implications of impact of AI on humanity (does not produce much anymore since he decided to be more IRL)
- [Lex Fridman podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman): he hosts all the famous philosophers, engineers, thinkers, doers in the world (always long format, very interesting)
